# Imposc

This project is an opportunity for me to gain experience of functional programming in Elixir, while at the same time indulging in a bit of nostalgia by revisiting the research I did for my PhD. I have not kept up to date with research developments in the field since I left academia and so nothing in this project is likely to contribute to current research. Instead my aim is to reproduce the programming aspect of the work I did then, but with the benefit of 3 decades of software engineering experience and using a language and programming techniques which were not available back then.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `imposc` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:imposc, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/imposc](https://hexdocs.pm/imposc).
