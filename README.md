This project is an opportunity for me to gain experience of functional programming in Elixir, while at the same time indulging in a bit of nostalgia by revisiting the research I did for my PhD. I have no kept up to date with research developments in the field since I left academia and so nothing in this project is likely to contribute to current research.
