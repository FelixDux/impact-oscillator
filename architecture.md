# Components
## Main Application
- **Core**: this is the bit which does the maths. It comprises functions which return nested collections suitable for 
JSON-ising.
- **Charts**: this accepts nested collections as generated by core functions and generates charts, which are either 
directed to the display or to PNG files.
- **Core wrapper**: accepts (JSON-compatible) nested collections as input and interprets them into core function calls, 
directing the output where appropriate to charts calls
- **Console interface**: runs in a terminal and accepts user commands, which it interprets into core and charts commands
via the core wrapper
- **REST server** REST API which accepts requests, which it interprets into core and charts commands via the core 
wrapper
- **Command line interface**: CLI which launches the application in one of three modes:

   - a one-shot mode which accepts JSON from the standard input, interprets it into core and charts commands via the core 
     wrapper, returns any text output (e.g. JSON) to the standard output and exits.
   - a mode which launches the console interface
   - a mode which launches the REST server
   
## Web Client
A web application which sends requests to the REST server. It provides froms for constructing requests (using the core 
wrapper) and renders the responses.
